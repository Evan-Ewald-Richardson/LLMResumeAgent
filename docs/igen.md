## Details
Integrated Engineering (IGEN) at the University of British Columbia offers one of the broadest engineering educations available, allowing students to customize their degree to align with their specific interests and career goals. This multidisciplinary focus spans at least two traditional engineering disciplines, ensuring that graduates have a strong foundation in areas such as materials, solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, and systems that may include chemical, electro-mechanical, or biological components.

A key aspect of IGEN is its emphasis on design and project management through a series of year-long design project courses. Students propose, design, and build real projects while learning crucial teamwork and communication skills. This intensive design experience enables students to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical context every year, distinguishing IGEN from many other programs.

The tight-knit community of IGEN students, capped at around 50 per year, fosters collaboration and constant improvement. Students have access to mechanical and electrical shops, 3D printing resources, and the freedom to select technical electives from any engineering department. By choosing 18 credits of technical electives, students can build depth in areas such as green energy, chemical processes, or circuit board design, effectively creating a personalized curriculum that suits their specific interests or professional goals.

Through co-op opportunities, IGEN students gain industry experience in different engineering roles before graduation. Many find that the diverse and customizable nature of the program makes them highly competitive in the job market, as they bring broad engineering expertise alongside specialized knowledge to their chosen field. Graduates often highlight the tight-knit community, the project-based learning model, and the flexibility of electives as major advantages of studying in the Integrated Engineering program at UBC.
