  - Refactored existing **AWS Lambda functions** to handle **expanded metric requirements** and updated **data formats**.
  - Replaced **iterative Excel/Pandas workflows** with a **batch-oriented Parquet/Polars approach**, reducing **processing time by 300%**.
  - Improved **data transformation and ingestion**, enabling **faster analytics and enhanced scalability**.

- **Cloud System Architecture & AWS Infrastructure**
  - Designed a **next-generation cloud system** integrating **on-premise ground servers, AWS MSK (Kafka), Lambda, S3, EC2, Redshift, and Glue**.
  - Conducted a **workflow analysis for future large-scale cloud migration**, ensuring seamless integration with **Databricks analytics**.
  - Developed **data streaming pipelines** using **Kafka** to facilitate real-time engine analytics.

- **Automated Documentation & CI/CD Integration**
  - Implemented **Sphinx Autodoc** with **CI/CD pipelines** to generate **living documentation** for both legacy and newly developed systems.
  - Ensured **cross-functional team collaboration** by maintaining clear, **self-updating technical documentation**.
  - Accelerated onboarding of **new employees and interns** by providing **well-documented API references and system architectures**.

- **Automated Testing Framework for AWS Step Functions**
  - Developed a **tiered testing framework** (unit, functional, end-to-end) for **AWS Step Functions**.
  - Automated **testing workflows with Pytest & PowerShell**, integrating them into **Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines**.
  - Streamlined **code review and release approvals**, reducing testing time and improving deployment efficiency.

### **Expanded Skillset & AWS Best Practices**
- **AWS Glue & Redshift Integration**: Migrated **batch processing workloads** from **legacy SQL Server pipelines** to **AWS Glue-based ETL jobs**, leveraging **Redshift** for optimized query performance and scalable analytics.
- **Cloud Data Warehousing**: Implemented **best practices for Redshift optimization**, including **distribution keys, sort keys, and materialized views**, to improve data retrieval efficiency.
- **Event-Driven Architectures**: Designed and tested **MSK (Kafka) streaming workflows**, improving **data freshness and scalability** for real-time analytics pipelines.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Worked with **CloudFormation** and **Terraform** to ensure reproducible infrastructure deployments for **Lambda functions, Redshift clusters, and Glue jobs**.
- **Scalable Data Pipelines**: Built **fault-tolerant ETL workflows** in **Glue**, integrating **multiple data sources** while ensuring **efficient error handling and retries**.
- **Security & Compliance**: Followed **AWS security best practices**, including **IAM least privilege principles, VPC configurations, and logging with CloudWatch** for auditing and compliance.

By optimizing **cloud-based aviation analytics**, Evanâ€™s contributions helped position **Pratt & Whitney Canada** for **more scalable and efficient data-driven decision-making** in the aerospace industry.
