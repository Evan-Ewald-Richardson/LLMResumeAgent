# Python: Core Language for Data Engineering, AI, and Automation

## Overview
Python has been a foundational tool in **data engineering, AI model development, and software automation** throughout my academic coursework, work experience, and personal projects. I have used Python extensively in **machine learning applications, API development, cloud computing, and data processing**.

- **AI & Machine Learning**: Built deep learning models using **PyTorch** in projects like the **AI-powered resume chatbot**.
- **Cloud & API Development**: Developed **FastAPI services** to serve **LLM-powered responses**, integrating with **Cloudflare and Webflow**.
- **Data Engineering & Automation**: Processed **large datasets** in **Pratt & Whitney's AWS pipeline** using **Polars, Pandas, and NumPy**.

## Technical Applications
Python has been used in various **high-impact projects**, applying **data processing, automation, and AI integration**.

- **Data Processing & Cloud Pipelines**  
  - At **Pratt & Whitney Canada**, replaced **Excel/Pandas workflows** with a **Polars-based batch processing pipeline**, improving efficiency by **300%**.
  - Designed **data ingestion and transformation pipelines** in **AWS Lambda, Glue, and Redshift**.
  - Automated **water-quality compliance reporting** at **Milestone Environmental** using **VBA, Power Automate, and Python scripting**.

- **AI Development & Machine Learning**  
  - Created a **RAG-powered LLM chatbot** using **Mistral 7B** and **DeepSeek-R1:8B**, integrating **FastAPI and vector databases** for structured retrieval.
  - Applied **BERT embeddings** and **HDBSCAN clustering** in the **Fair Ticket Price Regressor**, improving **semantic understanding of venue and artist data**.

- **Software & API Development**  
  - Built **Python backends** for AI projects, including the **self-hosted resume chatbot** running on **Ollama and Cloudflare**.
  - Developed **data APIs** in **FastAPI**, connecting **structured resume data** for **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.
