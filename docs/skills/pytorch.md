# AI Development with PyTorch: Building Efficient ML Models for Production

## Overview
PyTorch has been my **primary deep learning framework** for developing **LLM-powered applications, machine learning models, and AI-driven data processing**. My experience includes **RAG-based search, model fine-tuning, and cloud deployment**.

- **LLM-Powered Resume Chatbot**: Built a **retrieval-augmented chatbot**, serving **Mistral 7B/DeepSeek-R1:8B** via **FastAPI and Ollama**.
- **Generative AI & NLP**: Developed **BERT embedding-based price prediction models** in the **Fair Ticket Price Regressor**.
- **Deep Learning for Vision & Reinforcement Learning**: Studied CNNs, transformers, and RL in **CPSC 455: Deep Learning**.

## Technical Applications
Implemented **efficient, production-ready AI models** using **advanced deep learning techniques**.

- **LLM Deployment & Optimization**  
  - Hosted **self-contained LLM API endpoints** with **FastAPI & Cloudflare**, running **Mistral 7B on local GPUs**.
  - Optimized **prompt engineering and token retrieval** for **accurate, structured responses**.

- **Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling**  
  - Applied **Transformer-based NLP models** for **semantic search and experience filtering** in chatbot RAG systems.
  - Trained **CNNs and deep reinforcement learning models** in **CPSC 455 coursework**.

- **AI for Structured Data**  
  - Implemented **HDBSCAN clustering and text embeddings** to enhance **event classification** in ticket price prediction models.
  - Developed **feature engineering pipelines** for **regression modeling and structured AI workflows**.
