# CPEN 221: Software Construction at The University of British Columbia

## Overview
Completed **CPEN 221**, an intensive **software engineering course** focused on **object-oriented programming, abstraction, and concurrent systems**. Covered **data structures, software testing, exception handling, and design principles**, while completing **large-scale Java projects**.

- Implemented **abstract data types, design patterns, and multi-threaded applications**.  
- Developed **high-performance Java applications**, integrating **testing and debugging best practices**.  
- Mastered **software construction techniques** through **coding exercises, theory exams, and real-world projects**.  

## Technical Details
Studied **object-oriented programming, algorithmic problem-solving, and software verification**.

- **Object-Oriented Design & Abstraction**:  
  - Implemented **class hierarchies, inheritance, and polymorphism**.  
  - Designed **abstract data types (ADTs) using interfaces and encapsulation**.  

- **Software Testing & Code Correctness**:  
  - Applied **black-box and white-box testing**, leveraging **JUnit for unit tests**.  
  - Used **test-driven development (TDD) methodologies** to validate implementations.  

- **Concurrency & Multithreading**:  
  - Implemented **parallel algorithms using threads, mutexes, and synchronization**.  
  - Managed **race conditions and deadlocks** through **thread-safe programming**.  

- **Algorithms & Data Structures**:  
  - Implemented **Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, BFS, DFS, and tree-based structures**.  
  - Designed **efficient data structures using sets, maps, and trees**.  

## Skills Demonstrated
