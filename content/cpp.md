# C++: High-Performance Systems Programming in Robotics & Embedded Systems

## Overview
C++ has been critical in **motion control, firmware programming, and real-time applications** across my academic projects, work in control systems, and game development.

- **Robotics & Motion Control**: Developed firmware for the **MuraLine cable-driven mural robot**, modifying **Repetier/Marlin firmware** for **precision stepper motor control**.
- **Embedded Systems & Firmware**: Implemented **low-level motor control algorithms** for **ReMold's pin-actuated mold-shaping system**.
- **Game Development**: Created **core gameplay mechanics and UI systems** in **Unreal Engine 5** for **Ondaadad: Ancestors of Aamjiwnaang**.

## Technical Applications
C++ has been applied in **robotics, firmware development, and real-time applications**.

- **Robotics & Motion Systems**  
  - Led **firmware development** for **MuraLine**, integrating **SVG parsing, G-Code interpretation, and micro-stepper control**.
  - Configured **PID control loops** for **motion stabilization** in embedded systems.
  - Applied **state-space control and transfer functions** in **ELEC 341: Systems & Control**.

- **Embedded Software Development**  
  - Modified **Marlin/Repetier firmware** for **ReMold**, implementing **custom G-Code handling and stepper motor synchronization**.
  - Developed **microcontroller-based motion control** for **multi-axis CNC-inspired robotics projects**.

- **Game Development & High-Performance Computing**  
  - Used **C++ & Unreal Engine 5** for **quest systems, dialogue mechanics, and UI flow control** in **Ondaadad**.
  - Implemented **multi-threaded game physics simulations**, improving performance in **high-load rendering environments**.
